This project is a rewritting of my old [eMesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcpjqd3NSTE "eMesh") desktop application (SDL, openGL2, C++)

#### Here is the begining of something working. -> [try it !](https://s1pierro.github.io/Papier/)


to do :
 - clean, beautify and clarify code design
 - obtain funding to continue
 - generate assembly marks
 - generate autoclave tabs
 - automate pattern layout
 - enrich configuration options
 - generate laser-cut compatible documents
 - automate pattern selection
 - polish to fit with mobile devices

done:

 - application layout
 - loading 3D user models
 - manual pattern editing
 - added an alternative pattern editing mode (fast way) 
 - pattern flattening
