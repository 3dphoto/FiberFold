### A webapp to perform 3d print from desktop printer.
_This project is a (js) rewritting of my old [eMesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcpjqd3NSTE "eMesh") desktop application (SDL, openGL2, C++)_

 It aim to provide an enought advanced paper-crafting tool to be used as an alternative prototyping tool ( as [paperAce](https://github.com/s1pierro/paperAce "paperAce") does ). Beside being as simple as possible to use.

#### Here is the begining of something functional. [try it !](https://s1pierro.github.io/Papier/)
_touch devices are not fully supported yet, they will be soon_

### State

_FreakPOC_ - **\[Reasonably Secure Proof Of Concept.\]** - Release Candidate


### Goals :

 - Provide an enought advanced paper-crafting tool to be used as an alternative prototyping tool ( as [paperAce](https://plus.google.com/photos/118368888481050824788/album/6366533843773096817/6366533840814789570?authkey=CIr985KLmqXwTA "paperAce") does ).
 - Be as simple as possible to use.

### non-Goals :

 - texturing.
 - mesh editing.
 
###  Requirements

A browser that provides webGL.

### HowTo

####There is one way to do everything :

 - Create pattern
 - Extend pattern.
 - Merge patterns.
 - Split pattern.
 
  **Succiously hit two triangles.**


### Standards and technologies :

 - Javascript
 - WebGL ( throught three.js )
 - SVG
 - HTML
 - CSS


### Third party code libraries :

 - Three.js
 - Hammer.js ( comming soon to provide touch devices compatibility )
 - jQuery
 
### to do :

 - automate patterns final layout.
 - full mobile devices support.
 - clean, beautify and clarify code design.
 - obtain funding to continue.
 - make it able to generate autoclave tabs.
 - make it able to generate assembly marks.
 - make it able to generate laser-cut compatible documents.
 - automate pattern selection.
 - enrich configuration options.
 - OOP rewrite.

### done:

 - application layout.
 - loading 3D user models.
 - manual pattern editing.
 - added an alternative pattern editing mode (fast way).
 - pattern flattening.
 - scaling capability.
